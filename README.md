# Snake game

A Snake game I made back in 2019 when I started to learn Java. I used Java Swing an no other external libraries/engines for the graphics, I designed all the graphical elements in the game myself.
All the comments and the code itself is in German

## Main Functionalities

3. **Personalised game**: There is the possibility to choose between diffrent options that can increase the score if they make 
the game more difficult and decrease it when they make the game easier.
     <br><br>
 
- Golden Apple: The snake grows triple as much, it is possible to choose the probability of spawning compared to a normal apple
- Apple-Time-Function: A new apple gets spawned every x-second, instead of spawing a new apple after the snake eats one
- Turposnake: When clicking the space key the snake speeds up
- Obstacles: The only option that increases the score. Either 20 obstacles are spawned in the beginning or a new on every time an apple is eaten (with a max cap of 20)
- Mouse: The snake grows five times as much when catching the moving mouse
- New score calculation: Based on the options selected, in the bottom left corner it is shown by how much the score increases/decreases
